							<strong><h2>Step 1: Solidify your structure.</strong></h2><br>
							<h3>For four weeks, we do a one-hour weekly call to work on progressing your manuscript forward, regardless of your starting point. We start by focusing on your manuscript's structure, marketing with respect to title and cover content, and meeting your goals for the book as a whole.</h3>
							<br>
			
				
							
							</h3>
							<strong><h2>Step 2: Find the right words.</strong></h2><br>
							<h3>The following four weeks, we zoom in to the text in our weekly calls. With your structure in place, we can ensure the best possible use of vocabulary, grammar, and style, among many other elements, to captivate your target reader.<br><br>During this phase, a bit of time apart from our calls will be required of you to complete my writing prompts for certain pieces of your book. Additional support during this phase is also provided such as the opportunity for texts and audio messages.<br><br></h3>
							<br>
						
					
								
							</h3>
							<strong><h2>Step 3: Tie up loose ends.</strong></h2><br>
							<h3>Revising what you wrote is key for saving time and money during the editing process! For the last four weeks, we do weekly final checks together before the manuscript is ready to be edited.<br><br>We may move paragraphs and sentences around to best fit your intended message. This phase focuses on clarity and cutting away extra text that may distract from the main message (you can always save unused content for your next book!).</h3>

"I have known Sandi for more than a decade. Among her many gifts is her ability to proofread and edit documents and books. She has a strong artistic bent and sensibility and a bubbly personality to boot. She understands writers, whether that writer is aspiring to be Hemingway or is a business professional looking to up-level a work-related document.
 
Sandi has edited two of my books, each from distinctly separate genres, and was spot-on, expedient, and professional. Her ability to spy errors in spelling, grammar and word usage is phenomenal.
 
She is able to work under pressure and meet deadline demands without compromising the integrity of her work.
 
Sandi has a magpie eye for spotting other errors such as repeated phrases, paragraphs, or sections. 
 
Her rates are extremely fair given her effort, proficiency and results.
 
I look forward with excitement to working with Sandi in the future and recommend her without reservation or hesitation."<br><br>

						<h3><hr>
						"During the process of getting my book ready for sale, I used Sandi's proofreading and editing services. I must say I feel I made the best possible choice. Her ability to analyze the subject matter and create dialogue in hopes of keeping things authentic but relatable was amazing. I believe she loves what she does, which in my book, is a recipe for future business to be conducted between her and I for sure. People, do not miss out on one of the best editing services your money can buy.”

"Last summer, dealing with his serious illness, I was driven to write about my youngest brother.
Having no childhood dreams of authorhood, nor any cathartic desire to share our troubled
childhood with the world, I began writing/dictating memories respectfully in a journal and on
my phone. Now, what to do with these writings. Fortunately, I found Proofreader Sandi who, with a written sample and brief conversation,
appreciated my needs and personality. Even though the expert in her field of editing and
proofreading, she was ever ready to listen to my concerns or confusion, never pushing me, only
using gentle persuasion.<br><br>The biggest feat of accomplishment was convincing me to write an
introduction after having just written the book. 'Really?' I thought, 'After writing 30,000 words?' After reading her editing
suggestions, I realized I had to write more, which at first I thought preposterous. She soothed me by saying I did not have
to, the story spoke for itself. 'I never dreamed of writing this!!! Writing does not make me feel
better,' I grumbled ungraciously. Always the professional, she replied, 'And that’s your
introduction.'<br><br>The proof of Sandi’s perfection was during the publishing phase as Amazon and
IngramSpark approved the manuscript immediately because the proofreading was flawless. Readers have commented on the structure of the book, appreciating the independent, dated
milestones/memories within organized chapters, which could only have happened with Sandi’s
guidance. Thank you, Sandi, for your support and unwavering dedication to this story."<br><br>
