							<h3>I'm a full-time freelance book editor & proofreader. &#128218;
								
<br><br><b>Software:</b> Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat Pro, Apple Pages &#128187

							<br><br><b>Nonfiction</b><br> <br>My ideal client is someone who has a business book, nonfiction book, or memoir & they want to make sure it doesn't come off dry. I've been a huge business/self-help/leadership book nerd since I was 12! My life in the fine arts has shown me the power of story.

<br><br><b>Fiction</b><br> <br>When I edit fiction, I think of it in terms of cinematography. My ideal fiction client is someone who wants to strengthen their character development and dialogue. My background in acting & theater enables me to identify where authors can raise the stakes to keep their reader hooked and where they can make their characters more realistic, thus more relatable—especially "the bad guy."

&#8220; I have known Sandi for more than a decade. Among her many gifts is her ability to proofread and edit documents and books. She has a strong artistic bent and sensibility and a bubbly personality to boot. <br><br> She understands writers, whether that writer is aspiring to be Hemingway or is a business professional looking to up-level a work-related document.
 
Sandi has edited two of my books, each from distinctly separate genres, and was spot-on, expedient, and professional. Her ability to spy errors in spelling, grammar and word usage is phenomenal.
 
<br><br> She is able to work under pressure and meet deadline demands without compromising the integrity of her work.
 
Sandi has a magpie eye for spotting other errors such as repeated phrases, paragraphs, or sections. 
 
Her rates are extremely fair given her effort, proficiency and results.<br><br>
 
I look forward with excitement to working with Sandi in the future and recommend her without reservation or hesitation. &#8243;<br><br>

						<h3>
						&#8220; During the process of getting my book ready for sale, I used Sandi's proofreading and editing services. I must say I feel I made the best possible choice. Her ability to analyze the subject matter and create dialogue in hopes of keeping things authentic but relatable was amazing. I believe she loves what she does, which in my book, is a recipe for future business to be conducted between her and I for sure. People, do not miss out on one of the best editing services your money can buy. &#8243;

&#8220; Last summer, dealing with his serious illness, I was driven to write about my youngest brother.
Having no childhood dreams of authorhood, nor any cathartic desire to share our troubled
childhood with the world, I began writing/dictating memories respectfully in a journal and on
my phone. Now, what to do with these writings. Fortunately, I found Proofreader Sandi who, with a written sample and brief conversation,
appreciated my needs and personality. Even though the expert in her field of editing and
proofreading, she was ever ready to listen to my concerns or confusion, never pushing me, only
using gentle persuasion.<br><br>The biggest feat of accomplishment was convincing me to write an
introduction after having just written the book. 'Really?' I thought, 'After writing 30,000 words?' After reading her editing
suggestions, I realized I had to write more, which at first I thought preposterous. She soothed me by saying I did not have
to, the story spoke for itself. 'I never dreamed of writing this!!! Writing does not make me feel
better,' I grumbled ungraciously. Always the professional, she replied, 'And that’s your
introduction.'<br><br>The proof of Sandi’s perfection was during the publishing phase as Amazon and
IngramSpark approved the manuscript immediately because the proofreading was flawless. Readers have commented on the structure of the book, appreciating the independent, dated
milestones/memories within organized chapters, which could only have happened with Sandi’s
guidance. Thank you, Sandi, for your support and unwavering dedication to this story. &#8243;<br><br>

						&#8220; Editing with Sandra was fantastical from beginning to end; fantastical being part of my book title, a word in her bio and our experience working together! She is professional, talented and inspiring. <br><br> 

Sandi was outstanding at finding the voice of the story and the writer, making sure they were both consistent and clear throughout. She approached my complex and abstract storyline with an open mind and fully embraced it, honing it into something so much more than when I thought it was first “done”. The way she inspected and shifted the details ultimately turned my rough stone into a polished jewel.

<br><br>Sandra's work style provided me the perfect combination of feedback, instruction, boundaries and encouragement, making her an invaluable addition to my team. This is only the beginning! I look forward to working with her on the rest of my books in the series. &#8243;

		&#8220; I came across Sandi while I was writing my first ever book with SPS. I was very new and didn't have a clue how to do anything. I was struggling to find an editor who had experience writing a memoir about domestic abuse. <br><br> Sandi and I emailed back and forth many times before I decided to use her services. I chose to work with her as her prices were reasonable but also because I was very encouraged by her and how quickly she would respond to my many emails. It was very reassuring to have someone on my team who was also excited about my work and communicated well. <br><br> This is very important to me. Throughout the process Sandi would communicate what she was doing with my manuscript and how it was going. She went over it many times and very thoroughly. She did a great job at changing what needed to be changed without changing the tone or message of my story. This memoir is obviously near and dear to my heart and I was very vulnerable in writing it. She made me feel safe. I highly recommend Sandi. I am so happy that I chose her as my editor and look forward to working with her again. &#8243;<br><br>

						&#8246; I’ve wanted to write a book for years. I recently invested in a program to help me do just that. When I got to the editing phase I was blessed to find Sandi. <br><br>

I wanted this book to be relied absolute best it could be. Sandi was way more than an editor. Her guidance helped me take this book from being ‘ok’ to something I am very proud of. <br><br>

Her process was so valuable that I asked if she would be my guide from the start next time I want to write a book. Luckily, she said yes lol.<br><br>

Sandi is an absolute genius when it comes to shaping a book that both shows your genius AND speaks to a specific person.

Working with her will be the best investment you can make for yourself and your future readers. &#8243;
