								<h1><br><br>Hi! I'm Sandi.</h1>
							</header>
							<h3>I'm a writing coach from South Florida. I work with fiction and non-fiction authors alike. My background in writing, developmental editing, line editing, and copyediting allow me to help my authors hone in on their target audience to keep their ideal reader engaged and loyal. <br><br> Together, we edit or create a manuscript you can be proud of. I provide insider tips like how to make sure you don't run into technical issues throughout your indie author path, how to save money and time on editing, and clear steps for a smooth publishing process. <br><br> My calling is to help people find their voice. My background as a vocal teacher is my strength in encouraging my authors to not stop writing and to simplify the process to get the results they seek.<br><br><b>Fiction Genres:</b> Drama, Fantasy, Historical, Romance, Science fiction

<br><br><b>Nonfiction Genres:</b> Academic, Autobiography and memoir, Biography, Business, Creative nonfiction, Essay, DIY/how-to, History, Reference, Self-help, Textbooks

								<h1><strong>My Signature 3-Step Process&trade; <br><br>Coaching Package</strong><br><br><br>$1080</h1>
						



							
						
							<strong><h2>Step 1: Solidify your structure.</strong></h2><br>
							<h3>For four weeks, we do a one-hour weekly call to work on progressing your manuscript forward, regardless of your starting point. We start by focusing on your manuscript's structure, marketing with respect to title and cover content, and meeting your goals for the book as a whole. Chapters may move around, and titles and subtitles may change. It’s all part of the process!</h3>
							<br>
			
				
							
							</h3>
							<strong><h2>Step 2: Find the right words.</strong></h2><br>
							<h3>The following four weeks, we zoom in to the text in our weekly calls. During this phase, a bit of time apart from our calls will be required of you to complete my writing prompts for certain pieces of your book. Additional support during this phase is also provided such as texts and audio messages.<br><br>With your structure in place, we can ensure the best possible use of vocabulary, grammar, and style, among many other elements to captivate your target reader. We may move paragraphs and sentences around to best fit your intended message. This phase focuses on clarity and cutting away extra text that may distract from the main message (you can always save unused content for your next book!).</h3>
							<br>
						
					
								
							</h3>
							<strong><h2>Step 3: Tie up loose ends.</strong></h2><br>
							<h3>Revising what you wrote is key for saving time and money during the editing process! For the last four weeks, we do weekly final checks together before the manuscript is ready to be sent off to an editor. Don't worry—I can recommend someone awesome!</h3>

						<h3>“I’ve wanted to write a book for years. I recently invested in a program to help me do just that. When I got to the editing phase I was blessed to find Sandi.
							I wanted this book to be the absolute best it could be. Sandi was way more than an editor. Her guidance helped me take this book from being ‘ok’ to something I am very proud of.
							Her process was so valuable that I asked if she would be my guide from the start next time I want to write a book. Luckily, she said yes lol.
							Sandi is an absolute genius when it comes to shaping a book that both shows your genius AND speaks to a specific person.
							Working with her will be the best investment you can make for yourself and your future readers.”

							“I contracted the services of Sandra Wissinger last August to proofread my new book, <i>Marian Confirmation Companion</i>. 
							Sandra was very prompt in accomplishing this large job (42,000 words) and was done in record time—we were under a very tight deadline. Sandra was very professional and in addition made practical suggestions to improve my writing. I liked her work so much I am now contracting her to translate my book into Spanish. 
							Thank you, Sandi! Rating: five stars!”

						<h3>“Sandi helped me with my book <i>Grow to Your Fullest</i> with both copyediting and proofreading. 
						Sandi is very dedicated and committed to delivering high quality results. 
						As English is my second language, she took the time to correct some phrases and sentences so the stories in my book conveyed the right messages meaningfully. 
						She was willing to take the time to talk to me so I could understand the true meaning behind some phrases. 
						She is also very detail-oriented as a proofreader. I am highly satisfied with her service and would like to work with her in the future.<br/><br/>If you are looking for someone to do copyediting or proofreading for your book, I highly recommend her service.”
